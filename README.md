# Country Map 

You can visit this demo by visiting country-map.aaronlumsden.com

I wasn't sure if the URL that you provided was supposed to have corrs enabled or not. I thought it was a bit overkill to create a server backend to enable this so I used a service to proxy it through. https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/

If you need me to create a back end to allow this I'm happy to do so.
